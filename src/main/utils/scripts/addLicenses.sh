# Description:
# This script extracts the owner property and inception year from the pom.xml and
# creates headers in source files using this info. If the inception year property
# is missing from the pom.xml, the last modified date of the pom.xml is retrieved
# and added to the pom.xml.
# If no owner property was specified, the developer names are used instead.
#
# Arguments: none


# treat unset variables as an error when substituting
set -u
